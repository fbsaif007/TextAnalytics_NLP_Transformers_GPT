# TextAnalytics_NLP_Transformers_GPT
This repository contains the project that are related to text analytics with a focus of NLP. Not all of them are giving proper outputs yet due to limited GPU or better fine tuning. Will keep on working with them whenever I have some free time. Following is the list of projects:
* Clustering of Articles on Facebook, LinkedIn, and GooglePlus. Data: https://tinyurl.com/4enr384d
* Multi-Class Classification of Customer Service Queries at an Online Retailer. Data: https://tinyurl.com/48nf4f2m
* Feature Extraction from Booking.com Reviews. Data: https://tinyurl.com/fuadbinsaif
* Vocabulary and Sentiment Analysis of US Presidential Speeches. Data: https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches
